-> Classifiers General Function Syntax

[PAR_OUT] = train[DATA,PAR]
[OUT] = class[DATA,PAR_OUT]

- OUT, DATA and PAR are structs

- DATA.input = weight's matrix [pxN]
- DATA.output = label's matrix [cxN] 
- PAR = hyperparameters
- PAR_OUT (training) = updated hyperparameters
- OUT (test) = confusion matrix + accuracy rate (test)

-> Classifiers Functions

- Ex: MLP
- Training:	mlp_train
- Test:		mlp_class

-> Classification Methods

Ensembles
	Comitês / Experts group / more than one classifier -> just one answer
	Can be from the same type or from different types of classifiers

- EL			Ensemble Learning

- ARTIE			ART in Ensembles

- MUSCLE		Multiple SOM Clustering Ensemble

Robust Classifiers
	Better performance with outliers

Multilabel Classification
	overlapped neurons
	more than one weight vector associated to one neuron
	each neuron contains more than one label
	
Semi-supervised Learning
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning

Classification hierarchy
	Classify between groups, than classify between subgroups
